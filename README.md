# COVID19_py_extensions
The DA_COVID19.py file is using a python package (https://github.com/Kamaropoulos/COVID19Py https://pypi.org/project/COVID19Py/) to pull out data of COVID19 from John Hopkins University and csbs.org
The data is then arranged in a pandas dataframe, so that analysis can be performed on it. Or one can just use it to keep a check on the current situtation, for educational purposes :P
.
The India version does the same job, except it scraps data from mygov.in using BeautifulSoup library.
